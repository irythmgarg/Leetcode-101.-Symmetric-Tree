# Leetcode-101.-Symmetric-Tree
# 🌲 Symmetric Binary Tree Checker 🌲

Ever wondered if your binary tree is as balanced in beauty as a mirror reflection? 🪞  
This project implements an elegant recursive solution to check if a **binary tree** is symmetric around its center. 🌐

---

## 🚀 What It Does

It determines whether a given binary tree is a **mirror of itself** (i.e., symmetric) using a clean and efficient recursive approach.  
Perfect for LeetCode problems, system interviews, or just flexing your C++ skills 💪.

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity

| Operation         | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Symmetry Check 🧩 | O(n)             | O(h)             |

- **n** = number of nodes in the tree
- **h** = height of the tree (space due to recursion stack)
